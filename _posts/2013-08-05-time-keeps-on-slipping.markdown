title:  "Time Keeps on Slipping"
---

If you were hoping this blog post would have something to do with the timeless cinema classic Space Jam, I'm afraid you're about to be disappointed.

Time has a way of getting away from you when you're busy.  When you're in the middle of a big move maybe.  Say from one city to another.  In my case, from Sudbury, ON to Toronto, ON.  I only realize now that its been an entire month since I last wrote a blog post.  An entire month, just slipped out from underneath me.  It's not as though nothing happened, or that I didn't get anything productive done, or that there was nothing to mark the passage of time, but looking back it's hard to imagine where all the time went.

In a way, I could probably say the same about my entire life.  I've been alive for about 25 years now, somewhere in the neighborhood of 9,000 days or 210,000 hours, and yet I've accomplished so little with the time I've had.  I haven't achieved spiritual enlightment.  I haven't obtained monetary wealth.  I haven't learned even a fraction of things I'd like to learn over the course of my life.  And I haven't seen even a small portion of what the world has to offer me.  I've begun all of those things, but there's so much left to do, and what seems like so little time left to do it.

This month has helped me to really grasp the importance of what I do with my time.  Of whether or not lazing around on a Sunday and watching a tenth episode in a row of Justified is really worth the time it takes.  It seems like such a small sacrifice, to give up an afternoon, maybe a weekend, in pursuit of leissure, but compounded, it's hard not to imagine all that I could've accomplished in that time.

That isn't to say that I don't recognize the importance of downtime.  I'm a naturally introverted person, and so I know better than some how beneficial quiet reflection can be, both in maintaining a certain level of sanity, and in helping to digest the day to day hustle and bustle of life.

But with the publishing of this post, I pledge myself to be more conscious of my time, and to be even more productive than I've been in the last months.  I've made strides, but I feel I can lengthen my gait somewhat.  Take bigger steps.  Work harder, be better, move faster, grow stronger.

This post also has nothing to do with Daft Punk I'm afraid.  Or Kanye West, if you have no taste.
