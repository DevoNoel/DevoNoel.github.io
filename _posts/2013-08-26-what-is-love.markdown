title:  "What Is Love2d"
---

This'll be a fairly short post.  I'm getting started with Love2d today.  I'd hoped to participate in Ludum Dare #27, but it happened to clash with a very important commitment I'd already made that I simply couldn't get out of (nah, just kidding, I went to Fan Expo instead to get my hands on the PS4 and buy some merch).  Regardless though, I thought I would get my hands dirty in a new framework, and prepare myself for Ludum Dare #28.

After approximately 12 seconds of consideration, I settled on Lua + Love2d.  I have a lot of experience with C#, so picking up MonoGame would've been a breeze, but where's the fun in that?  Love2d and Lua fall more in-line with what I like in a programming language/framework: simplicity, readability, and convenience.  So it was really a pretty easy choice for me.

This post marks the beginning of a journey into new technology for me, which I'll be documenting here.  I'll post my progress as it happens, maybe even with some pretty screenshots.  Well, maybe not that pretty, this'll also be my first real foray into pixel animation, and it might get a little hairy.  Wish me luck.
