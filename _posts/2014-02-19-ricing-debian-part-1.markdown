title:  "Ricing Debian - Part 1"
---

Like most developers, designers, makers, and creative people since everyone stopped hitting each other with stones so much and started farting around with paint brushes and fancy words, I occasionally get distracted.  Like in that previous run-on sentence for instance.  Really, if I'm being truthful, it's not very occasional.  It's pretty much every second of my free time.  Usually I get distracted by marathoning video games (my first love), Netflix's accursed autoplay feature, or pesky social obligations preventing me from hiding in a cave like I'd prefer. But sometimes, I fool myself into thinking I'm being productive by working on something tangentially related to creation, such as my current side-side-project (not my main side-project, you see): Ricing Debian.

<!--excerpt-->

Let me first preface this by explaining what the hell I'm talking about.  Ricing in this case is a term on loan from the exciting world of automotive racing, or going zoom-zoom in layman's terms.  A "rice car" is one where extensive cosmetic modifications have been made to the vehicle, but upgrading the vehicles performance has been neglected, where "ricing" refers to this modification process, and a "ricer" is someone who partakes in ricing.  Rice cars are usually of Asian make, hence the name, although it is also often attributed to the acronym "Race Inspired Cosmetic Enhancement".

In this case however, I'm applying this term to the world of GUI modifications in Linux.  I've worked with a number of different distros over the past few years; Ubuntu, Debian, CrunchBang, ElementaryOS and ArchLinux to name a few.  I've enjoyed them all, but no matter what the distro, I've always found some small gripe to get me to move on, and the default settings out of the box never keep me satisfied for long (with the exception of Arch, since it has practically nothing out of the box).  To this end, I've decided to take the time to definitively put together an environment I plan to keep for a reasonable amount of time, and to keep myself interested in it, I plan to rice the shit out of it.

What will therefore follow in future articles is a step-by-step account of my adventures.  I've decided on Debian as my distro, as a good middleground between usable and powerful.  While I've previously enjoyed how bleeding-edge ArchLinux is, it makes for too unstable of a dev environment in my opinion.  I will be ditching broad swathes of Debian's default configuration however, first and foremost being GNOME.  I'll update this article with links to future parts as I progress.
