        <h3>03 Sep 2013</h3>
        <p>Even this blog post, perhaps.  Definitely this blog post, I&#39;d say.  Question what you had for dinner last night.  Was it really chicken alfredo, or does <em>the patriarchy</em> just want you to think it was chicken alfredo.  Who knows?  Do you?  Question that too.</p>

<p>Moving on from being deliberately confusing.  The tech industry is a fast-moving, ever-changing maelstrom of an industry. Its easy to get sucked in by the variety of new technologies emerging every day, and the various opinions surrounding them.  Keeping up to date, and keeping your skills relevant, is important for survival.  If you&#39;re not constantly improving yourself, you run the very serious risk (read: the certainty) of being left behind.</p>

        <h3>24 Jul 2013</h3>
        <p>Passion is a largely romanticized concept, especially in the hacker culture.  Following your dreams must be so liberating!  Every day must be a new adventure!  Oh how happy it must make you to be the master of your own destiny!  On and on.  I think its very rarely that simple though.  Following dreams isn&#39;t something you do because its a fun; it&#39;s something you do because you just can&#39;t help yourself.  Because if you don&#39;t, you feel physically ill.  Because if you don&#39;t, you can&#39;t sleep.  Following your dreams requires more than a love for your dream, or the idea of your dream.  It requires fanaticism.</p>
