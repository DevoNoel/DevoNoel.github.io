<p>Or maybe writing.</p>

<p>I’ve been giving a lot of thought to the power of collaboration lately. I believe the reason why open source software has become so prevalent in the past several years is that nobody can do something better than everybody combined can. Collaborating on a project is a powerful method of creation, and when done properly, the result is often far more than the sum of its parts. We as humans are social animals, even the introverts like myself, and we’re at our best when we work together.</p>

<p>I think that moving forward in software, we should be giving thought to new ways we can help people collaborate with one another. This is already handled brilliantly within software development itself through services like GitHub, but I think that we can apply that same concept to new fields if we’re creative about it.</p>

<p>It’s for this reason that I’ve chosen to take on two projects that I feel have this spirit of cooperation at their core. Both are also related to writing, which is often traditionally a solitary pursuit.</p>

<p>The first project I’m working on focuses on helping writers connect with proofreaders, as a sort of collaborative copyediting community. You proofread my work, I’ll proofread yours, everyone wins. It’s a fairly simple concept at this point, and while I’ve started designing a landing page, it is still very much just an idea. I should note that this particular concept is not my idea; I’ve decided to take it on pro bono for a client. He’s graciously included me heavily in the decision making process however, and it’s become largely a joint venture at this point.</p>

<p>The second project I’m working on involves providing inspiration to authors. Let’s say that you have a great idea for a story, or play, or a screenplay, but you know you’ll never get around to actually writing it. And let’s say that there’s a writer out there experiencing severe writer’s block, who just can’t seem to come up with an idea for a story. See where I’m going with this? If not, you get an F on your assignment, see me after class.</p>

<p>Both of these ideas are in the very early stages, and I have no idea if either of them will pan out at all. But I expect that regardless of what they evolve into, that I’ll continue to focus on the idea of collaboration as a powerful tool for good.</p>
