		<p>If you were hoping this blog post would have something to do with the timeless cinema classic Space Jam, I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;re about to be disappointed.</p>

<p>Time has a way of getting away from you when you&#8217;re busy. When you&#8217;re in the middle of a big move maybe. Say from one city to another. In my case, from Sudbury, ON to Toronto, ON. I only realize now that its been an entire month since I last wrote a blog post. An entire month, just slipped out from underneath me. It&#8217;s not as though nothing happened, or that I didn&#8217;t get anything productive done, or that there was nothing to mark the passage of time, but looking back it&#8217;s hard to imagine where all the time went.</p>

<p>In a way, I could probably say the same about my entire life. I&#8217;ve been alive for about 25 years now, somewhere in the neighborhood of 9,000 days or 210,000 hours, and yet I&#8217;ve accomplished so little with the time I&#8217;ve had. I haven&#8217;t achieved spiritual enlightment. I haven&#8217;t obtained monetary wealth. I haven&#8217;t learned even a fraction of things I&#8217;d like to learn over the course of my life. And I haven&#8217;t seen even a small portion of what the world has to offer me. I&#8217;ve begun all of those things, but there&#8217;s so much left to do, and what seems like so little time left to do it.</p>

<p>This month has helped me to really grasp the importance of what I do with my time. Of whether or not lazing around on a Sunday and watching a tenth episode in a row of Justified is really worth the time it takes. It seems like such a small sacrifice, to give up an afternoon, maybe a weekend, in pursuit of leissure, but compounded, it&#8217;s hard not to imagine all that I could&#8217;ve accomplished in that time.</p>

<p>That isn&#8217;t to say that I don&#8217;t recognize the importance of downtime. I&#8217;m a naturally introverted person, and so I know better than some how beneficial quiet reflection can be, both in maintaining a certain level of sanity, and in helping to digest the day to day hustle and bustle of life.</p>

<p>But with the publishing of this post, I pledge myself to be more conscious of my time, and to be even more productive than I&#8217;ve been in the last months. I&#8217;ve made strides, but I feel I can lengthen my gait somewhat. Take bigger steps. Work harder, be better, move faster, grow stronger.</p>

<p>This post also has nothing to do with Daft Punk I&#8217;m afraid. Or Kanye West, if you have no taste.</p>
